# Headlamp

Headlamp is an easy-to-use and extensible Kubernetes graphical UI.

Headlamp was created to be a Kubernetes UI that has the traditional functionality of other
web UIs/dashboards available (i.e. to list and view resources) as well as other features.

## Features

  * Vendor independent / generic Kubernetes UI
  * Works in-cluster, or locally as a desktop app
  * Multi-cluster
  * Extensible through plugins
  * UI controls reflecting user roles (no deletion/update if not allowed)
  * Clean & modern UI
  * Cancellable creation/update/deletion operations
  * Logs, exec, and resource editor with documentation
  * Read-write / interactive (actions based on permissions)

### Accessing

Headlamp uses [RBAC](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac) for checking
whether and how users can access resources. If you try Headlamp with a token that has very limited
permissions, you may not be able to view your cluster resources correctly.

See the documentation on [how to easily get a Service Account token](https://headlamp.dev/docs/latest/installation#create-a-service-account-token) for your cluster.
