## Changelog Automation

The changelog automation script simplifies the process of generating a changelog for our project's releases. While certain steps remain manual for quality assurance, much of the procedure is automated to save time and effort.

### GitHub Token

Before running the script, ensure you have a GitHub personal access token. This token helps prevent potential issues with GitHub rate limits. If you don't have one already, generate a token by visiting [GitHub Tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens).

### Define the Latest Release Tag

The following example assumes weâ€™re going from version 0.22.0 (v0.22.0) to 0.23.0 (v0.23.0). Check Increasing version number for details on how to identify what the next version should be.

Export the release version.

```bash
# Example: export NEW_RELEASE_TAG="v0.23.0"
export NEW_RELEASE_TAG=""
```

Create a release branch from latest main

```bash
git fetch origin && git checkout -b release-$NEW_RELEASE_TAG origin/main
```

Make sure your git status is clean.

```bash
git status
```

### Running the Script

Execute the script to generate the changelog file (scripts/changelog.md). Review the output and make any necessary adjustments for the release.

```bash
scripts/changelog.sh
```
