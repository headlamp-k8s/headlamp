Headlamp is an easy-to-use and extensible Kubernetes web UI.

Headlamp was created to blend the traditional feature set of other web UIs/dashboards
(i.e., to list and view resources) with added functionality.

## Quickstart

If you want to deploy Headlamp in your cluster, check out the instructions on running it [in-cluster](https://headlamp.dev/docs/latest/installation/in-cluster/).

If you have a kubeconfig already, you can quickly try Headlamp locally as a
[desktop application](https://headlamp.dev/docs/latest/installation/desktop/)
for [Linux](https://headlamp.dev/docs/latest/installation/desktop/linux-installation),
[Mac](https://headlamp.dev/docs/latest/installation/desktop/mac-installation),
or [Windows](https://headlamp.dev/docs/latest/installation/desktop/win-installation).
**Make sure** you have a kubeconfig file set up with your favorite clusters and
in the default path so Headlamp can use it.

### Accessing

Headlamp uses [RBAC](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac) for checking
users' access to resources. If you try Headlamp with a token that has very limited
permissions, you may not be able to view your cluster resources correctly.

See the documentation on [how to easily get a Service Account token](https://headlamp.dev/docs/latest/installation#create-a-service-account-token) for your cluster.

## Tested platforms

We maintain a list of the [Kubernetes platforms](./docs/platforms.md) we have
tested Headlamp with. We invite you to add any missing platforms you have
tested, or comment if there are any regressions in the existing ones.
