Some users prefer running Headlamp using the desktop app, but in their web browser instead of
Electron's environment. This allows them to leverage the browser's functionality, such as
bookmarks, groups, etc.

Running Headlamp in the system's browser can be done by using the `--headless` CLI option.
Assuming you have already downloaded and installed Headlamp on your desktop, you can run it in headless mode as follows:

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux" default>
    ```bash
    flatpak run io.kinvolk.Headlamp --headless
    ```
    or 
    ```bash
    ./Headlamp.AppImage --headless # for AppImage
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="macOS" label="MacOS">
    ```bash
    ./Headlamp --headless
    ```
    
    If you have installed using brew then,
    ```bash
    /Applications/Headlamp.app/Contents/MacOS/Headlamp --headless
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">
    ```powershell
    ./Headlamp.exe --headless
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
