      <description>Headlamp&amp;rsquo;s backend is written in Go and is in charge of redirecting the client requests to the right clusters, as well as to return any available plugins for the client to use.
The backend most basic and essential function is to read the cluster information from the given configuration, and set up proxies to the defined clusters as well as endpoints to them. This means that instead of having a set of endpoints related to the functionality available to the client, it simply redirects the requests to the defined proxies.</description>
