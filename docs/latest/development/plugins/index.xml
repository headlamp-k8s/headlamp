      <description>This section will walk you through a basic plugin development.
Types If you are using Typescript for developing the plugin, the @kinvolk/headlamp-plugin package does ship some type declarations in @kinvolk/headlamp-plugin/types. Please notice that the whole external plugin mechanics are still in an early development phase and thus only the actual type declarations (and not the corresponding code) is shipped in this package at the moment.
import { Headlamp, Plugin, Registry } from &amp;#39;@kinvolk/headlamp-plugin/lib&amp;#39;; Plugin Class Plugins are classes that register actions when they are initialized.</description>
