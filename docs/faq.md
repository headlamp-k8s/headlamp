## Usage and Features

### Can I monitor multiple clusters with Headlamp?

Yes, Headlamp allows you to monitor multiple clusters. You can switch between different clusters using the cluster switcher in the Headlamp interface.

### Can I manage my Kubernetes resources directly through Headlamp?

### Headlamp is not showing delete/edit/scale buttons in a resource, why is that?
